# The-Stupid-Rocket
The Stupid Rocket (TSR) is my 1st year end project using C language

TSR is a machine learning program formed from pure curiosity and eagerness to use this project opportunity to take my first step on my expedition to learn more about artificial intelligence.The TSR project idea is simple, its sole purpose is to bring passengers from the starting location to the final destination while avoiding floating asteroids. Even though TSR is just a basic simulation, but the path-finding algorithm can be quite challenging. In this project, there will be 2 fundamental path-finding Ais âˆ’ Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). Once the path is discovered,the TSR will display the path onto the screen- which marks the end of the program.
